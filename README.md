# Client Portal
I am building this application to help me manage various client communications.

## Contact Rest end-point
This is the module that will receive client messages from the <strong>contactme</strong> form on my portoflio site.

## Proposal Manager
This feature will help me manage the lifecycle of my proposals. It will have an admin page for building and distributing new proposals. It will also have a dashboard to help me monitor the approval status for a proposal. It will also have a feature for automatically prompting clients to review and approve a proposal.
